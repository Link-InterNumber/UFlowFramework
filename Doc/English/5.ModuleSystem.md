## üåê Module Hub

### üìñ Overview

In most commercial games, singleton scripts are usually defined to distinguish and manage different gameplay content.

UFlow uses interfaces, combined with tools such as `EventManager` and `SingletonBase<T>` within the framework, to give singletons a lifecycle.

Developers can inherit the required interfaces according to the functional modules' needs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Usage

#### üöÄ 1. **Startup Process**

`ModuleManager` will call initialization when the game starts, after the resource tools are loaded.

`ModuleManager` will use reflection to obtain the instantiable types of `SingletonBase<T>` and `MonoSingleton<T>`, and instantiate them uniformly.

After that, you can add or delete module singletons in the management yourself.

Therefore, in general, developers do not need to manually instantiate these managers.

#### üìú 2. **Interface Introduction**

UFlow internally provides `SingletonBase<T>` and `MonoSingleton<T>` as base classes for the singleton pattern.

The difference is that the `MonoSingleton<T>` implemented singleton will have a `GameObject` on the scene as a carrier, so you can directly use its `transform`, `gameObject` and Unity lifecycle.

Note that in some cases, if you want some singletons to be instantiated earlier than other singletons, you can sort the classes with `[ModuleInitOrder(int order)]`. Singletons without `ModuleInitOrder` will be at the end of the generated sorting.

Building a module manager is as simple as:

```csharp
// Use ModuleInitOrder to mark the module instantiation order, the smaller the number, the earlier the instantiation
[ModuleInitOrder(300)]
public class ExampleModuleManager : SingletonBase<ExampleModuleManager>
{
    // your code...
}

[ModuleInitOrder(100)]
public class ExampleMonoManager Ôºö MonoSingleton<ExampleMonoManager>
{
    // your code...
}
```

Developers can use the provided interfaces to modify the `SingletonBase<T>` manager. `MonoSingleton<T>` can inherit only `IModule` because it has Unity lifecycle functions itself.

The following are the provided interfaces:

```csharp
public interface IModule : IDisposable
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Automatically initializes the module when the program is initialized
    /// Inherit IDisposable, call Dispose() when the game process is closed or manually removed by the module manager
    /// </summary>
    public void OnInit();
}

public interface IOnGameStartModule : IModule
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Called when the EventManager.instance.onStartGame event is triggered
    /// </summary>
    public void OnGameStart();
}

public interface IOnGameResetModule : IModule
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Called when the EventManager.instance.onResetGame event is triggered
    /// Generally called when the player exits the current account and returns to the login screen
    /// Data can be reset here
    /// </summary>
    public void OnGameReset();
}

public interface IExecutionModule : IModule
{
    public bool inExecution { set; get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Executed in Unity's Update
    /// </summary>
    public void Execute(float dt);
}

public interface ILaterExecutionModule : IModule
{
    public bool inExecution { set; get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Executed in Unity's LaterUpdate
    /// </summary>
    public void LaterExecute(float dt);
}

public interface IEventModule : IModule
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Called once when the manager is instantiated, generally used for event registration
    /// </summary>
    public void RegisterEvent();
    /// <summary>
    /// Called when the manager is removed or the game process is stopped, generally used for event unregistration
    /// </summary>
    public void UnRegisterEvent();
}
```

#### üïí 3. **When you need a temporary singleton**

In some cases, you do need a convenient type that allows you to get the data you need at any time, and you also want to delete it when you don't need it.

Of course, you can, just use `TempMonoSingleton<T>`.

`TempMonoSingleton<T>` is basically `MonoSingleton<T>`, but `TempMonoSingleton<T>` is not managed by `ModuleManager`, so the `IMudule` interface has no practical effect on it, and developers need to manage this instance themselves.

Building a `TempMonoSingleton<T>` is very simple:

```csharp
public class ExampleTempManager ÔºöTempMonoSingleton<ExampleTempManager>
{
    public override void Init(object data)
    {
        base.Init(data);
        // do something with data...
    }

    public void SomeLogic()
    {
        // do something...
    }
}
```

How to use it in code:

```csharp
// Instantiate a temporary singleton
TempMonoSingleton<ExampleTempManager>.Create(data);

Debug.Log(TempMonoSingleton<ExampleTempManager>.isExist); // true

// Call singleton logic
ExampleTempManager.instance.SomeLogic();

// Destroy the instance of the singleton
ExampleTempManager.instance.Deinit();

Debug.Log(TempMonoSingleton<ExampleTempManager>.isExist); // false
```

It should be noted that if the singleton is created again without destroying it, the previous singleton (including GameObject) will be destroyed, and the singleton will only point to the newly instantiated object.
