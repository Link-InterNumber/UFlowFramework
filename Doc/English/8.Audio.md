# Audio Management Tool Documentation

## üéµ **Tool Features**

1. **Modular Design**
    - The audio management tool is divided into multiple modules, supporting various audio types such as Background
      Music (BGM), Ambience, Dialog, 3D Effects (Effect3D), and UI Effects (UIEffect).
    - Each audio type has independent management logic without interference.

2. **Object Pool Optimization**
    - Manages audio sources (`AudioSource`) using an object pool to reduce performance overhead caused by frequent
      creation and destruction of audio objects.

3. **Flexible Audio Control**
    - Supports volume adjustment, mute, fade-in/out, pause, and switching audio groups.
    - Supports spatial processing (`spatialBlend`) for 3D effects.

4. **Asynchronous Loading Support**
    - Audio resources are loaded asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread.
    - Automatically loads audio resources using file paths, supporting dynamic loading and unloading.

5. **Event-Triggered Playback**
    - Provides trigger components (`AudioTrigger`) and setter components (`AudioSetter`) to play audio through physical
      collisions or UI events.

6. **Extensibility**
    - Designed with interfaces (e.g., `IBgmPlayer`, `IDialogPlayer`) for easy extension and customization of audio
      playback logic.

7. **Group-Based Audio Management**
    - Supports managing audio in groups for unified control and switching between different audio groups.
    - For example: Background Music Group, Ambience Group, etc.
    - Allows switching to a new audio group while retaining the current audio state.
    - Supports fade-in/out during group switching to avoid abrupt transitions.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**

### 1. **Initialize the Audio Manager**

The audio manager initializes automatically at game startup, no manual invocation is required.  
Ensure `AudioManager` is attached to a `GameObject` and set to `DontDestroyOnLoad`.

```csharp
protected override void Awake()
{
    base.Awake();
    DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
    InitEffectPlayer();
}
```

---

### 2. **Play Audio**

Playing background music or ambience involves the concept of groups. Background music switches based on the group.

- **Default Group**: `MusicGroup.Default`

#### a. **Play Background Music (BGM)**

```csharp
AudioManager.instance.PlayMusic("MusicClipPath", MusicGroup.Default, fadeoutTime: 0.5f, intervalTime: 0.3f, fadeinTime: 0.5f);
```

#### b. **Play Ambience**

```csharp
AudioManager.instance.PlayAmbience("AmbienceClipPath", MusicGroup.Default, fadeoutTime: 1f, intervalTime: 1f, fadeinTime: 1f);
```

#### c. **Play Dialog Audio**

```csharp
AudioManager.instance.PlayDialog("DialogClipPath", () => Debug.Log("Dialog Finished"));
```

#### d. **Play 3D Effects (Effect3D)**

Effect playback uses a queue mechanism to avoid stuttering during playback.  
It also limits the simultaneous playback of the same effect to prevent audio clutter.

You can adjust the interval time for the same effect by modifying `effectIntervalTime`, default is **0.1f**.

- **Bind to an Object**:

```csharp
AudioManager.instance.RequestPlayEffect("EffectClipPath", false, attachedGameObject, Vector3.zero, true);
```

- **Play at a Specific Position**:

```csharp
AudioManager.instance.RequestPlayEffect("EffectClipPath", false, null, new Vector3(0, 0, 0), true);
```

#### e. **Play UI Effects (UIEffect)**

```csharp
AudioManager.instance.RequestPlayEffect("UIEffectClipPath", true, null, Vector3.zero, false);
```

#### f. **Switch Audio Groups**

- **Switch Background Music Group**:

```csharp
bool success = AudioManager.instance.SwitchMusicGroup(MusicGroup.Battle);
if (success)
{
    Debug.Log("Switched to Battle Music Group");
}
```

- **Switch Ambience Group**:

```csharp
AudioManager.instance.SwitchAmbienceGroup(MusicGroup.Nature);
Debug.Log("Switched to Nature Ambience Group");
```

---

### 3. **Volume Control**

#### a. **Get Volume**

```csharp
float volume = AudioManager.instance.GetVolume(AudioSourceType.Music);
```

#### b. **Set Volume**

```csharp
AudioManager.instance.SetVolume(AudioSourceType.Music, 0.8f, transferTime: 0.3f);
```

#### c. **Get Maximum Volume**

```csharp
float maxVolume = AudioManager.instance.GetMaxVolume(AudioSourceType.Effect3D);
```

#### d. **Set Maximum Volume**

```csharp
AudioManager.instance.SetMaxVolume(AudioSourceType.Effect3D, 1.0f);
```

---

### 4. **Mute and Unmute**

#### a. **Mute**

```csharp
AudioManager.instance.Mute(AudioSourceType.Music, transferDuration: 0.5f);
```

#### b. **Unmute**

```csharp
AudioManager.instance.Unmute(AudioSourceType.Music, transferDuration: 0.5f);
```

---

### 5. **Triggers and Setters**

#### a. **Using `AudioTrigger`**

- Add the `AudioTrigger` component to objects that need to trigger audio.
- Automatically plays audio when a collision occurs.

#### b. **Using `AudioSetter`**

- Add the `AudioSetter` component to UI or objects that need to play audio.
- Set the audio path and trigger conditions (e.g., `playOnEnable`, `playOnUp`, etc.).
- The `AudioClip` configured in `AudioSetter` is not directly assigned to the `AudioSetter` but is implemented by
  recording the path.
- This approach allows dynamic loading of audio resources at runtime, avoiding the limitation of directly referencing
  audio files in the editor.

#### c. **Button Component and Audio**

- `ButtonAddAudioEditor` can quickly add audio triggers to `Button` components.
- In the `Button` Inspector panel, click the `Add Up AudioTrigger` button to add an audio trigger for the `PointerUp`
  event.
- Click the `Add Down AudioTrigger` button to add an audio trigger for the `PointerDown` event.
- After adding, the audio trigger will automatically attach the `AudioSetter` component and set the corresponding
  trigger conditions (e.g., `playOnUp` or `playOnDown`).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes**

1. **Audio Resource Paths**
    - Ensure the audio resource paths are correct and loaded into the project.

2. **Object Pool Management**
    - The audio manager uses an object pool to manage `AudioSource`. Ensure the pool capacity is sufficient to avoid
      playback failures.

3. **Audio Type Distinction**
    - Different audio types (e.g., BGM, Effect3D) have independent volume and mute settings that need to be managed
      separately.

4. **Fade-In/Out Time**
    - Ensure reasonable time values for fade-in/out to avoid abrupt audio transitions.

5. **Performance Optimization**
    - Avoid frequent creation and destruction of audio objects. Use object pools to manage audio playback whenever
      possible.

6. **Extensibility**
    - If custom audio playback logic is needed, implement related interfaces (e.g., `IBgmPlayer`, `IDialogPlayer`) and
      replace the default implementation.
