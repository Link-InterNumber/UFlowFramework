# UFlow Framework Documentation

## 😀 Introduction

This framework is an efficient toolkit designed for Unity project development, aiming to simplify the development
process, improve code reusability, and maintainability. The framework supports modular development, provides rich
functional components, and is suitable for both game and non-game applications.

## 🛠️ Feature Overview

### 1.📦 **Modular Architecture**

- Supports project division by functional modules, facilitating code management and reuse.
- Main modules:
    - Discrete resource loading
    - Page-Window UI system
    - Data persistence
    - Event system
    - Business module framework
    - Configuration table tools
    - Object pool
    - Simple audio management
    - Localization system based on Unity.Localization
    - Runtime business data management
    - Red dot system
    - Guidance system
    - Packaging tools
    - Other utility modules, etc.

### 2.🖼️ **UI Management System**

- Based on Unity's `Canvas` system, providing convenient UI interface management.
- Manages UI collections using a parent-child relationship of page-window, with page layers using a stack structure to
  switch between different UI collections.
- Simple code implementation, requiring only a few methods to develop a new interface.

### 3.📑 **Convenient Configuration Table Tools**

- Configuration table import tool developed based on EEPlus, supporting data storage in JSON, binary, and ScriptObject (
  not recommended).
- Provides editing tools and windows to generate configuration table classes and resources with one click, and supports
  integrating the generation process into custom build workflows.
- JSON and binary configuration table resources support encryption/decryption.

### 4.📢 **Event System**

- Built-in event manager supporting global event subscription and broadcasting.
- Provides type-safe event mechanisms with duplicate registration warnings, reducing runtime errors.
- Offers an event mechanism that responds only once at the end of the frame, avoiding repeated calls within the same
  frame.

### 5.📂 **Resource Management**

- Supports asynchronous resource loading to optimize loading performance.
- Provides a resource caching mechanism to reduce redundant loading.
- Integrates the Addressables system for dynamic resource management.
- Adopts a discrete resource loading scheme, with local resource self-management to avoid difficulties in managing
  shared resources across modules.
- Uses interfaces for code development, facilitating the extension of other third-party resource management plugins.

### 6.🌐 **Networking Module**

- Provides HTTP and WebSocket encapsulation, supporting common network requests.
- Built-in data serialization and deserialization tools supporting Protobuf format, with protocol data packet encryption
  and decryption.

### 7.💾 **Data Management**

- Provides a global data manager supporting the storage and retrieval of game states and user data.
- Supports comprehensive persistent data storage solutions, including JSON, binary datasets, PlayerPrefs, and
  screenshots, with local encryption/decryption for JSON and binary data.

### 8.📝 **Logging System**

- Built-in logging tools supporting multi-level log output (e.g., Debug, Info, Warning, Error).
- Supports log file saving for troubleshooting.

### 9.🔧 **Utility Library**

- Provides common utility classes, such as time management, mathematical calculations, and string processing.
- Integrates extended Unity features, such as object pooling, music/sound effect playback, and build packaging.

### 10.🔗 **Extension Support**

- Supports quick integration of third-party plugins.
- Provides custom extension interfaces to facilitate developers in extending framework functionality.
