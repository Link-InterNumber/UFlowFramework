# UI System

## 😀 Overview

The UI solution used within the framework is a Unity-based UI framework that uses a Page-based stack management logic,
providing functions such as loading, displaying, closing, and managing interfaces.
The main interfaces are as follows:

| Interface Name       | Purpose                                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IUIComponent`       | Base interface for `IUIParent` and `IUIChild`.                                                            |
| `IUIParent`          | Parent node interface, including loading, displaying, and closing management of child nodes.              |
| `IUIChild`           | Child node interface, with two special sub-interfaces `IUIPoolable` and `IUIStandAlone`.                  |
| `IUIPoolable`        | Inheriting `IUIPoolable` will load and store from the dedicated object pool IUIParent.                    |
| `IUIStandAlone`      | Inheriting `IUIStandAlone` will display at the top layer of the UI and is not managed by the Page system. |
| `IOpenWindowRequest` | Intermediate layer on the parent node used to manage the process of loading child nodes.                  |

The following shows the structure of the UI framework:

```plaintext 
IUIParent
    |
    └──> IOpenWindowRequest──>IUIChild;
                                |
                                |──> IUIPoolable;
                                |
                                └──> IUIStandAlone;
```

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1.✨ **Creating UI**

#### a.🌟 **Create a Page class, inheriting `UIPage`**

The page in the framework serves as a container for windows and does not require a prefab.

When calling to open a page, the system will create a `GameObject` and add the page component to it. Therefore, try not
to add functions that **require mounting components** on the page.

Based on the above description, it can be inferred that opening a page is actually a synchronous creation. Therefore,
developers can immediately operate on the created page.

The following is the instance code for a page:

```csharp
public class TestPage : UIPage
{
    public override void OnOpen(object data)
    {
        // Called when the Page is opened
    }

    public override void OnClose()
    {
        // Called when the Page is closed
    }

    public override void RegisterEvent()
    {
        // Register events
    }

    public override void DeregisterEvent()
    {
        // Unregister events
    }
    
    public override void OnFocus()
    {
        // Called when focus is gained
    }
}
```

#### b.🖼️ **Create a Window class, inheriting `UIWindow`**

Having only a page will not display any visible interactive interface. You need to load a window on the page.

Unlike pages, you need to build a prefab for each window and mount the required components in advance.

The window uses the `[WindowInfo(string path, bool ignoreRaycast = false)]` attribute to mark the prefab path. When
opening the window, the prefab path is obtained through reflection and then loaded through the page's `IAssetLoader`.

Window loading is an asynchronous process, and the interface must be loaded before it can be operated.

The following is the instance code for a window:

```csharp
// WindowInfo is used to mark the UI prefab path location
[WindowInfo(path: "Assets/Res/WindowPrefabPath.prefab", ignoreRaycast: false)]
public class TestWindow : UIWindow, // Depending on the needs, you can inherit IUIPoolable or IUIStandAlone
{
    protected override void OnWindowInit()
    {
        // This will be called in base.RegisterEvent(), allowing operations before the Window is opened.
        // do something...
    }

    public override void RegisterEvent()
    {
        // Register events
        if(closeBtn) closeBtn.onClick.AddListener(OnCloseBtnClick);
    }
        
    public override void DeregisterEvent()
    {
        // Unregister events
        if(closeBtn) closeBtn.onClick.RemoveListener(OnCloseBtnClick);
    }
        
    public override void OnOpen(object data)
    {
        // Called when the UI is opened
    }

    public override void OnClose()
    {
        // Called when the UI is closed
    }

    public override void OnFocus()
    {
        // Called when focus is gained
    }
}
```

#### c.🔧 **Flexibly utilize the Page-Window system**

The purpose of building Page-Window is that in most commercial projects, there are multiple scenes (main interface,
battle, backpack, etc.). When switching between different scenes, the previous UI combination is usually closed, and
then a new UI combination is opened. The concept of page can summarize these different combinations together to
facilitate the management of different UI scenes.

At the same time, because pages are managed in a stack mode, the current window state can be retained when closing. When
the top page is closed, the next page will automatically open. This allows you to return to the previous scene.

The following is an example scenario:

```plaintext

    | BattlePage                    |
    |       ├── BattleMainWindow    |
    |       └── TaskWindow          |
    | LobbyPage                     |
    |       ├── LobbyMainWindow     |
    |       ├── ChatRoomWindow      |
    |       └── TaskWindow          |
    | LoginPage                     |
    |       ├── SignInWindow        |
    |       └── SignUpWindow        |
    └───────────────────────────────

```

##### d.🚪 **Open page**

Open `LoginPage` when entering the game, then open `SignInWindow`, and open `SignUpWindow` as needed.

```csharp
public class LoginPage : UIPage
{
    public override void OnOpen(object data)
    {
        base.OnOpen();
        var lastUserId = LoadLastUserId();
        // You can directly open the window when the page is opened
        UIManager.instance.OpenWindow<SignInWindow>(lastUserId);
    }

    ...
}

...
// Open LoginPage somewhere
public void ReadyForGame()
{
    UIManager.instance.PushPage<LoginPage>();
}
...

```

After completing the login, the player enters the lobby. After using `UIManager.instance.PushPage`, `LobbyPage` will
enter the top of the page stack. At this time, the interface on `LoginPage` will not be closed. Only after opening a new
interface, `LoginPage` will automatically close.

```csharp
UIManager.instance.PushPage<LobbyPage>();
UIManager.instance.OpenWindow<LobbyMainWindow>();
UIManager.instance.OpenWindow<ChatRoomWindow>();
UIManager.instance.OpenWindow<TaskWindow>();
```

##### e.❌ **Close page**

In the above situation, `LoginPage` may not be opened again for a long time. There are two ways to remove `LoginPage`.

When opening a new page, use the `pushMode` parameter in
`UIManager.instance.PushPage<T>(object data = null, PagePushMode pushMode = PagePushMode.CloseOther)`. Passing in `UImanager.PagePushMode.Replace` will close the page at
the top of the current stack and destroy it.

The original code is changed to:

```csharp
UIManager.instance.PushPage<LobbyPage>(pushMode: UImanager.PagePushMode.Replace);
UIManager.instance.OpenWindow<LobbyMainWindow>();
UIManager.instance.OpenWindow<ChatRoomWindow>();
UIManager.instance.OpenWindow<TaskWindow>();
```

Or call `UIManager.instance.ClosePage<T>(bool destroy = true, Action callback = null)` to manually destroy `LoginPage`.

The original code is changed to:

```csharp
UIManager.instance.PushPage<LobbyPage>();
UIManager.instance.OpenWindow<LobbyMainWindow>();
UIManager.instance.OpenWindow<ChatRoomWindow>();
UIManager.instance.OpenWindow<TaskWindow>();

UIManager.instance.ClosePage<LoginPage>(true);
```

##### f.🔄 **Pop the top of the page**

After entering BattlePage:

```csharp
UIManager.instance.PushPage<BattlePage>(replaceMode：false);
UIManager.instance.OpenWindow<BattleMainWindow>();
UIManager.instance.OpenWindow<TaskWindow>();
```

After the player finishes the battle, they want to return to the lobby:

```csharp
UIManager.instance.PopPage();
```

At this time, `BattlePage` is popped from the top of the stack and the destruction process is carried out.

And `LobbyPage` becomes the page at the top of the stack. At this time, the `LobbyPage.OnFocus()` method will be called,
and then the window that was still open when the page was closed will be obtained, and their respective `OnFocus()`
methods will be called from the top layer to the bottom layer according to their display order.

In fact, in this case, both `LobbyPage` and `BattlePage` exist in the page stack, and you can also call

```csharp
UIManager.instance.PushPage<LobbyPage>(pushMode: UImanager.PagePushMode.Replace);
```

to achieve a similar effect, but at this time `LobbyPage` calls the `OnOpen()` method instead of the `OnFocus()` method.
The windows under it will not call their respective `OnFocus()` methods.

##### g.🔄 **Display New Page in Overlay Mode**
When you need to use a new page without closing the current one, you can use pushMode: UIManager.PagePushMode.Overlap.

In this mode, the previously opened page will not be closed, and the parent node for any subsequently opened windows will be the new page.

```csharp
UIManager.instance.PushPage<PlayerInfoPage>(pushMode: UIManager.PagePushMode.Overlap);
```

### 2 ⛺ Special Window Interfaces

The framework provides two Window interfaces, `IUIPoolable` & `IUIStandAlone`.

Windows that inherit `IUIPoolable` will be recycled to the dedicated object pool Page when closed.

Inheriting `IUIStandAlone` will display at the top layer of the UI and is not affected by the current Page switch.

The usage of opening/closing is the same as normal windows, and no additional operations are required during use.

### 3 ⚠️ Precautions

1. Lifecycle of Page and Window
    - The OnOpen and OnFocus methods of Page are called when opening and gaining focus, respectively.
    - Window loading is asynchronous and must be operated after loading is complete.

2. Page stack management
    - Pages are managed in the form of a stack, and automatically return to the next Page after the top Page is closed.

3. Window path marking
    - Use [WindowInfo] to mark the prefab path of the Window to ensure the path is correct.

4. Resource management
    - The loading of Page and Window depends on IAssetLoader, and it is necessary to ensure that the resource management
      tool is working properly.

5. Two windows of the same type are not allowed on one Page.
