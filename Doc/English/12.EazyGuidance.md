# üìò Introduction to In-Game Guidance System

This in-game guidance system is a modular and extensible framework designed to provide game developers with
user-friendly guidance functionalities. Through this system, developers can easily implement interactive guidance
features such as tutorials and functional hints to enhance user experience.

# ‚ú® Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Independent functional modules for easy expansion and maintenance.
- **High Flexibility**: Supports multiple guidance types (UI guidance, Sprite guidance, etc.).
- **Configurability**: Controls guidance flow via configuration files and supports dynamic loading.
- **State Management**: Saves and restores guidance progress to ensure continuity.
- **Event-Driven**: Triggers guidance logic through events, decoupling business logic from guidance logic.

# üõ†Ô∏è System Functions

1. **Guidance Management**:
    - Centralized management via `GuidanceManager`.
    - Supports registration, deregistration, activation, and deactivation of guidance.
    - Provides progress saving and loading.

2. **Guidance Tags**:
    - Uses `GuidanceTag` and its subclasses to mark guidance targets.
    - Supports UI elements and scene objects.

3. **Guidance Windows**:
    - Displays guidance content using `GuidanceWindow`.
    - Supports dynamic loading of UI prefabs.

4. **Triggers**:
    - Supports multiple trigger types (e.g., clicks, submissions).
    - Includes implementations like `GuidanceTagUI` and `GuidanceTagSprite`.

# üìö Usage Guide

## 1. Configuration

- Define guidance sequences, triggers, and UI prefab paths in configuration files.
- Ensure compatibility with `ConfigManager`.

## 2. Adding Guidance Tags

- Attach `GuidanceTag` or subclasses (e.g., `GuidanceTagUI`) to target objects.
- Assign unique `guidanceIndex` values.

## 3. Initialization

- Initialize the manager at game launch via `GuidanceManager.OnInit()`.
- Activate specific guidance using `GuidanceManager.SetGuidanceOn(index)`.

## 4. Customization

- Inherit `GuidanceTag` to implement custom logic.
- Override `OnExecute` and `OnDeExecute` for start/end behaviors.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

1. **Unique Indices**: Ensure each `guidanceIndex` is unique to avoid conflicts.
2. **Prefab Paths**: Verify UI prefab paths in configurations to prevent loading errors.
3. **Progress Saving**: Use the manager‚Äôs state-saving feature to retain progress across sessions.
4. **Event Handling**: Avoid duplicate registration or missing deregistration of events in `GuidanceWindow`.

# üöÄ Example Code

```csharp
// Activate guidance
GuidanceManager.instance.SetGuidanceOn(1);

// Custom guidance tag
public class CustomGuidanceTag : GuidanceTag
{
    public override void OnExecute()
    {
        Debug.Log("Guidance started");
        // Custom logic
    }

    public override void OnDeExecute()
    {
        Debug.Log("Guidance ended");
        // Custom logic
    }

    public override Vector2 GetUIPosition()
    {
        return transform.position;
    }
}
```
